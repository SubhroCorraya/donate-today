            <p>
                It’s easier to take than to give. It’s nobler to give than to take. The thrill of taking lasts a day.
                The thrill of
                giving lasts a lifetime.

                    “Hunger is not a problem. It is an obscenity. How wonderful it is that nobody need wait a single
                    moment before starting
                    to improve the world.”

                    shelter; that it is a way
                    of improving your way of life.”

                <p>
                    “We believe all children love to learn, want to learn and are capable of learning. We believe all
                    parents want a better
                    life for their children and all teachers prefer motivation and achievement to apathy and failure.
                    Nevertheless, we
                    recognize that the complexities behind generational poverty require us to be innovative and often
                    disruptive to make
                    real learning possible.”
